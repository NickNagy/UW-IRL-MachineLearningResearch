# UW-IRL-MachineLearningResearch

I had the opportunity to work for the Imaging Research Lab at the University of Washington, where we adapted UNET and RetinaNet for X-Ray segmentation and fracture detection, respectively. Most of my role was modifying code from https://github.com/jakeret/tf_unet and from https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet. This repository is mostly for scripts and files I created to help with our pre-processing and analyses of these networks. I've also included a research report I wrote for one of my college quarters, albeit the results and methods are flawed.
